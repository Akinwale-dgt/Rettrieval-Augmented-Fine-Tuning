Given the physically demanding nature of construction work, there are growing interests among stakeholders in the adoption of exoskeletons. Exoskeletons are wearable robotic systems designed to provide bodily support and reduce the risk of overexertion. Exoskeletons are categorized based on the specific body parts they support, including leg-support, back-support, shoulder-support, and full body-support (Poliero, Fanti, Sposito, Caldwell, & Di Natali, 2022).\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cot_answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3270,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\\n\\n1. **Understand the Question**: The question asks for the equation used to calculate joint angles in the study. This means we need to identify the specific formula provided in the context for this purpose.\\n\\n2. **Locate Relevant Section**: The context includes a section titled \\\"JOINT ANGLE CALCULATION AND ERGONOMIC RISK ASSESSMENT,\\\" which is likely where the equation for joint angle calculation is described.\\n\\n3. **Extract Key Information**: Within this section, the context explicitly mentions the equation used for calculating joint angles. Let\\u2019s extract the relevant part.\\n\\n   ##begin_quote##\\n   Based on the estimated 2D worker posture, we calculated the joint angles related to the position of the worker's neck, torso (trunk), upper arms, lower arms, wrists, and lower limbs (upper leg, lower leg, and knee) using the following equation:\\n\\n   \\\\[\\n   \\\\theta = \\\\cos^{-1} \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{a}_i^j \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{b}_k^l}{\\\\|\\\\mathbf{a}_i^j\\\\| \\\\|\\\\mathbf{b}_k^l\\\\|}\\\\right), \\\\text{ where } i, j, k, l \\\\in \\\\{1, ..., 16\\\\}; \\\\; i \\\\neq j \\\\text{ and } k \\\\neq l \\\\tag{1}\\n   \\\\]\\n   ##end_quote##\\n\\n4. **Interpret the Equation**: The equation provided calculates the angle (\\\\(\\\\theta\\\\)) between two vectors (\\\\(\\\\mathbf{a}_i^j\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\mathbf{b}_k^l\\\\)) using the inverse cosine function. The formula involves the dot product of the vectors in the numerator and the product of their magnitudes in the denominator.\\n\\n5. **Confirm Completeness**: The context provides all necessary details about the equation, so we can confidently use it as the answer.\\n\\n### Final Answer:\\n<ANSWER>: The equation used to calculate joint angles is \\\\(\\\\theta = \\\\cos^{-1} \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{a}_i^j \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{b}_k^l}{\\\\|\\\\mathbf{a}_i^j\\\\| \\\\|\\\\mathbf{b}_k^l\\\\|}\\\\right)\\\\).
